The world builder app is a lightweight application meant for writers who want to organize the events and lore of their stories. Specifically, it serves to graphically display events in a chronological order so the writer can check themselves for continuity and consistency errors. To aid in this, detailed notes from the writer are always at the ready as well as a list of all the relevent events for the timeline they are building. With any luck, and a willingness to self-critisize, a storyteller can use this tool to open up a whole new world of creativity.
